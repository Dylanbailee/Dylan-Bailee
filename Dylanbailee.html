      <p>
      G'day I'm Dylan, Dylan Bailee as most know! Starting out as a DJ since 2013 and having a strong craving to produce music of my own to share with the public, I have progressed significantly from the start and hope to push further in the future. There's not really much about me to say besides I love to do what I do and hope to become internationaly recognised on a wide scale, I'm open minded for any new idea's and trouble thrown at me during this journey. I am a former DJ and Promoter for South East Sounds here in Melbourne and have performed at Club Pandora, looking to expand my venue variety for future events... If you ever notice me doing a set or walking around blatantly looking for things to do, don't be shy to come and say hello and kick your feet up with me, as i treat everyone equally on the floor just as much as I do to those on stage.
